# generateN_bits-with-condition-
Design a recursive function such that
Given an integer n (ï‚³ 0), output all binary strings of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits = the sum of the second n bits. For example, if n = 2, then the algorithm should output:
	0000, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1111
